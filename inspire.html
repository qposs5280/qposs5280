        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.

        		While a fictional character, Ted Lasso is a kind hearted, all inclusive, Kansas City BBQ loving American football coach that ends up coaching European football. His journey is incredibly heartwarming as we learn the dynamics and lifes of Lasso and the team. Some of the topics that were handled spectactularly were:
    		</p>
		<section>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Self worth - Teaching and empowering people</li>
        		<li>Cultural awareness - Learning and respecting other peoples ways of life</li>
        		<li>Personal development - Finding all the unique aspects that help people grow</li>
        		<li>Societal norms - Primarily targetting toxic masculinity</li>
        		<li>Other people are people too - People around you are going through their own struggles</li>
    		</ul>
		</section>
    		<p>
        		His constantly overflowing optimism can be a bit much, but the more I watched Ted Lasso, the more I realized how much the world needs people like him around. Ted Lasso is a man founded in the principle that everyone deserves to be their best selves, and to be curious, not judgmental.
