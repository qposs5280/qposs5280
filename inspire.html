        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.

        		While a fictional character, Ted Lasso is a kind hearted, all inclusive, Kansas City BBQ loving American football coach that ends up coaching European football. His journey one that warms the heart as we learn the dynamics and lifes of Lasso and the team. Some of the topics that were handled spectactularly were:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Self worth - Teaching and empowering people</li>
        		<li>Cultural awareness - Learning and respecting other peoples ways of life</li>
        		<li>Personal Growth - Finding all the unique aspects that help people grow</li>
        		<li>Societal norms</li>
        		<li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		His constantly overflowing optimism can be a bit much, but the more I watched Ted Lasso, the more I realized how much the world needs people like him around. Ted Lasso is a man founded in the principle that everyone deserves to be their best selves, and to curious, not judgmental.
