      <h1>Amuse Me</h1>
       <h3>by Quinton Possehl</h3>
    <p>The internet is vast and if you want to find something, chances are its out there. Most come looking for entertainment, and that's exactly what you're going to find here.</p>
  

    <h2>Go-To</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite youtube channels to visit is Daily Dose of Internet. Unfortunatly, there aren't daily uploads like the channel title would imply, but they upload a video around 3 times a week. These 2-3 minute videos are short clips that include anything from fun fails, cool science happenings, or cute animal clips.</p>

    <h2>AI Art</h2>
    <p>Something that has been cacthing my attention recently is this Twitter account that uses AI to create images. You send a prompt or string of words to the account and it uses software to search the web and creates an image. People have done things such as Heaven and Hell, celebrities, and even "florida man" to see the true mastermind behind some of the wacky news stories coming out of Florida</p>

    <h2>How Unexpected...</h2>
    <p>One of the other places I like to visit to kill some time is Reddit. I could be here for a while listing off the subreddits that I go through, but probably the one I like the most is r/Unexpected. As name implies, it shows videos or pictures of unexpected things. Just a warning though, a portion of the content is considederd "Not Safe For Work" due to the nature of the content sometimes being violent or otherwise, but there is still a lot to enjoy and get surprised by on this page. </p>
